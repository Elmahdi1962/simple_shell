.SH  NAME
simple_shell \- Simple command interpreter (shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
SImple SHell is a command language interpreter that executes
commands read from the standard input or from a file.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The only argument that should be supplied to the shell
is the name of a file. When this happens,
the shell reads and	executes commands from this	file, then exits.
The shell's exit status is the exit status of the last command
executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit
status is 0. An attempt is made to open the file in
the current directory.
." and, if no file is found,	then the shell searches	the
." directories	in PATH	for the	script.

.SH DEFINITIONS
.PP
The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this
document.
.PD 0
.TP
.B blank
A space or tab.
.TP
.B word
A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.
.TP
.B name
A
.I word
consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.
.TP
.B control operator
A
.I token
that performs a control function. It is one of the
following symbols: \fB || && ;

.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
.SS Simple Commands
A
.I simple command
is a sequence of
.B blank
-separated words that are terminated by a
.I control operator
. The first word specifies the command to be
executed, and is passed as argument zero. The
remaining words are passed as arguments to the
invoked command.

.Br
The return value of a
.I simple command
is its exit status or 128+
.I n
if the command is terminated by signal
.I n

.SH COMMENTS
In a non-interactive shell or an interactive shell, a word beginning
with a
.B #
causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.
Comments are on by default.

.SH QUOTING
.I Quoting
is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
words to the shell, such as operators or whitespace.
There are two types of quoting: matched single quotes,
and matched double quotes.

.SS Single Quotes
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal meaning of all
the characters (except single quotes, making it impossible to put
single-quotes in a single-quoted string).

.SS Double Quotes
Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal
meaning of all characters except dollarsign as they're used to signify
the start of a variable or special parameters like ? and $.

.SH ALIASES
An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the alias builtin command.
Whenever a word is read, the shell
checks the word to see if it matches an alias.
If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its value.
For example, if there is an alias called
"put"
with the value
.Dq "echo -e" ,
then the input:
.Pp
.Dl put "\e[31mCool\e[0m" Aq return
.Pp
would become
.Pp
.Dl echo -e "\e[31mCool\e[0m" Aq return
.Pp
Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create shorthands for
commands.
They can also be used to create lexically obscure code.
This use is discouraged.

.SH SIGNALS
When
.B simple_shell
is interactive, it catches and handles
.B SIGINT
(so that pressing Control+C does not kill an interactive shell).

.SH HISTORY
On startup, the history is initialized from the file .simple_shell_history in the $HOME directory.
This file is truncated to
contain no more than 4096 lines of command strings. When the shell startsup,
the first line number is set to  the number of lines in the .simple_shell_history file modulo 4096
(the history size).
 If the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved.

.SH SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
This section lists some built-in commands, which are built-in because
they are needed to perform some operations which cannot be performed
by a different process.
.TP
\fBalias\fP [\fIname\fP[=\fI'value'\fP] ...]
Running
.B alias
with no arguments prints the list of aliases in the form
.I name=
.I'value'
. When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each
.I name
whose
.I value
is given. A trailing blank or control operator in
.I value
causes the next word to be checked for alias
substitution when an alias is expanded. For each
.I name
in the argument list for which no
.I value
is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.
.B Alias
returns true unless a
.I name
is given for which no alias has been defined.

.TP
\fBcd\fP [\fIdir\fP]
Change the current directory to \fIdir\fP.
If \fIdir\fP is not supplied, the value of the
.SM
.B HOME
shell variable is the default.
Any additional arguments following \fIdir\fP are ignored.
An argument of
.B \-
switches
.SM
.B $OLDPWD
with \fB$PWD\fP.
If
\fB\-\fP is the first argument, and the directory change is
successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is
written to the standard output.
The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed;
false otherwise.

.TP
.B env
Prints all the environment variables in the shell.

.TP
\fBexit\fP [\fIstatus\fP]
Cause the shell to exit
with a status code of \fIstatus\fP.  If
.I status
is omitted, the exit status
is that of the last command executed.

.TP
\fBhelp\fP [\fIBUILTIN\fP]
Prints the help page of a builtin command \fIstatus\fP. If
no arguments are provided, a short information about the
program and built-in commands usage syntax
are printed.
If
.I BUILTIN
is not a built-in command or there are too many arguments, the
return value is false and an error message is printed to the
standard error output.

.TP
\fBhistory\fP
Displays all the lines of commands that have
executed by the shell. Returns false if an argument is
provided and prints some error to the standard error output.

.TP
\fBsetenv\fP \fIVARIABLE\fP \fIVALUE\fP
Sets the environment variable with the name \fIVARIABLE\fP
to have the value \fIVALUE\fP
If
.I VARIABLE
is not a valid variable or there are too many or insufficient
arguments, the return value is false and an error message is
printed to the standard error output.

.TP
\fBunsetenv\fP \fIVARIABLE\fP
Removes an environment variable with the name
\fIVARIABLE\fP. No error is thrown if \fIVARIABLE\fP
does not exist. Returns false if an argument isn't
provided or there are too many arguments.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
HOME
This environment variable functions as the default argument for
the cd builtin.
.TP
PATH
The default serch path for executables.
.TP
PS1
The primary prompt string, which defaults to "$ ".
.TP
PWD
The logical value of the current working directory. This is set by
the \fBcd\fP command.
.TP
OLDPWD
The previous logical value of the current working directory. This is set by
the \fBcd\fP command.

.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP
.I /bin/simple_shell

.TP
.I $HOME/.simple_shell_history
